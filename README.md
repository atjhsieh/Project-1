# Project-1
First project for data analytics bootcamp.
Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process

Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis

Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least two per "question" you ask of your data)

Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for use in your presentation

Optionally, use at least one API, assuming you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation.

This will be a formal presentation. 

One in which you explain in detail:

The questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
Your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary as well as visualizations of that summary
Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".
All presentations will be recordedâ€¦

So treat it seriously! 

These can be great portfolio pieces if you invest the time.

Stick to data sources that:

	Are sufficiently large

	Have a consistent format

	Ideally contain more data than needed 

	Are well-documented

Feel free to ask your instructors for input!
