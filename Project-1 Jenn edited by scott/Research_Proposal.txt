RESPProject Title: Energy Generation with Health, Income, and Emissions
Team Members: Scott M, Alex H, Evan O, Rob G, and Jennifer H

Project Description/Outline:

Looking at the effects of health, income, and emissions through the lens of energy generation by type of energy generated.
These effects will be shown from 2000 to 2014 for the US and by state if we have time. Income and emissions will be measured yearly and by wages and CO2 levels, respectively,
while health data will be measured by respitory illness by state and year at five year intervals.  

Research Questions to Answer:
	- How does the fluctuation of energy source generation effect emissions?
	- How does emissions effect respiratory health?
	- How does energy source generation relate to income?
	- Are there any other economic factors that could explain these relationships?

Data Sets to be Used:
	- health respiratory data: Mortality rate for respiratory diseases from 1980-2014 (globalhealthdataexchange)
	- emissions: emissions and generation resource integrated database (epa.gov) 
	- energy source generation:annual generation of energy by state (eia.gov)
	- labor/wages: income by year from 1984-2017 (census.gov)
	- households in the us by year/emissions per households (TBD)
